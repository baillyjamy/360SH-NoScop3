HERE IS OUR AMAZING SH3LL BASED ON ASTONISHINGS MLG CONTENTS
2 KILL ALL OF THOSE DAMNED HATERS BECAUSE WE ARE HCKRS

HATERS PLZ STAY FAR AWAY FROM THIS PROJECT



## /\/\/\/ DWNLD & BU1LD \/\/\/\

USE `GIT CLONE --RECURSIVE` BUT IN L0WERCAS3 OF COURSE EXCEPT IF
U ARE A L00S3R (I DONT USE LOWERCASE LETTERS SINCE I'M A HCKR)

WITHOUT `--RECURSIVE` IT DOESN'T CLONE THE SUBMODULES, SO U WILL
NEED 2 TYPE `GIT SUBMODULE UPDATE --INIT` AS A L00S3R

IF U HAVE COMPILATION ERRORS IN EGC, TRY 2 REGENERATE THE "GLISTS":

```
cd egc
make glist_clean
cd ..
make re
```



## /\/\/\/ DPENDENCIES \/\/\/\

YOU NEED A POSIX-COMPLIANT OPERATING SYSTEM TO BE ABLE TO BUILD
OUR SH3LL

IF YOU TRY TO BUILD IT FOR WINDOWNS THEN YOURE A REAL L00SR

MOREOVER, THIS PROJECT DEPENDS ON
[EGC](https://github.com/motet-a/egc) - IT IS "SHIPPED" IN THE
REPOSITORY AS A SUBMODULE



## /\/\/\/ XMPLS \/\/\/\

TODO: ADD SOME EXAMPLES OF OUR SH3LL HERE



## /\/\/\/ AB0UT US \/\/\/\
